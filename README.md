# LiveProjectsTemplate
This is a template, which lays out a structure for a main project. It can be used by any team working on an MMU LiveProject.

**NOTE**: Your live projects are PUBLIC, on both GitHub and Trello meaning anyone can see them. 

**To keep you and your client safe**, here are some ground rules:

* **NO authentication data:** 
  * usernames, passwords
  * shared secrets
  * tokens
* **NO real names** 
  * no personally attributable data of any sort

**Your repo will turn up on public searches.** Likely initiated by people just like yourself; desperate for information. Please help them!

* Keep your code clear and consise
* Constructive comments only
* Give a helpful overview or how-to in a readme.md
