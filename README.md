# LiveProjectsTemplate
This is a template, which lays out a structure for a main project. It can be used by any team working on an MMU LiveProject.

**NOTE**: Your live projects are PUBLIC, on both GitHub and Trello meaning anyone can see the data in them. 

To keep you and your client safe, here are some ground rules:

* **NO authentication data:** 
  * usernames, passwords
  * shared secrets
  * tokens
* **NO real names** 
  * no personally attributable data of any sort
